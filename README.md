# Deliberate Developer
### Consistency & Focus: Learn at least one new topic a day

##### Mock Interviews, Timed & Recorded Practice.
##### Repetition: Review in 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 days. Flashcards, Solve Problems.
##### Use Checklists, Track & eliminate mistakes

### Detailed plan

* Learn each concept throughly, by coding. Split the complex problems to sub tasks and solve bottom up.
* Understand and remember key concepts of all DS and Algo. (Use Anki Flashcard)
* In intervals practice problems from each concept.(Spaced repetition)
* Separate the learning and performance sessions. In learning can pause read etc. But in performance sessions practice as if you are in an interview.

* At the beginning of Practice session
	* Review the weak-links(definition below).
	* Start a timer
	* Read the question, understand well and draw diagrams.
	* Think aloud as you will do in a real interview.
	* Prepare multiple possible inputs and outputs. This helps to see the pattern.
	* Consider edge cases.
	* Ask clarifying questions.
	* Design the solution and put it in plain English
	* Use all the hints when stuck.
	* Check the correctness and Consider Time and space complexity.
	* Do Dry run and observe what is repeating. See if can be improved. Use hashtable/hashmap.
	* Ensure all unique inputs are working correctly before submitting. Each submission costs.
	* Keep improving until got a solution with acceptable complexity before coding.
	* Commit the code to github, with time taken. Can be used later for analysis.
* At end of each practice session.
	* Take note of things you got wrong, places you got stuck. Add to a list. Let's call it weak-links.
	* Make flash cards from the learning.
